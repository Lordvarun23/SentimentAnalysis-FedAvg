# SentimentAnalysis-FedAvg
This repository contains code for Sentiment Analysis using Federated Learning. Federated Learning is a technique that allows multiple clients to train a global model without sharing their data with a central server. This approach is useful when data privacy is a concern or when the data is too large to transfer over the network.
